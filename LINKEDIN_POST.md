I built a "Smart Mirror" for Stuttering Therapy 🪞

Growing up, I often heard the advice: "Practice in front of a mirror." It’s a classic technique, but a regular mirror can’t tell you *why* you’re blocking or remind you to breathe when you’re stuck.

So, I decided to build an app for myself and the countless others who stutter.

This tool acts like that mirror, but with intelligence. Using computer vision and speech recognition, it detects:
🔹 **Blocks** (Open mouth or pressed lips silence)
🔹 **Repetitions** (Stuttering on sounds/words)
🔹 **Secondary Behaviors** (Rapid blinking, facial tension)

When it detects a struggle, it doesn't just watch—it provides real-time visual feedback and breathing guides to help ease through the moment.

⚠️ *Note: This is still a prototype! It has some false positives and rough edges that I'm actively working on rectifying. I built this to solve a real problem I face daily, and I’d love your feedback to make it better.*
