70 million people worldwide stutter.

I'm one of them.

For years, people told me: "Just practice in front of a mirror."

But here's what they don't tell you:

A mirror can't detect when you're blocking.
It can't remind you to breathe when anxiety takes over.
It can't show you the subtle facial tensions you don't even realize you're doing.

So I built something that could. 🪞✨


Introducing: A Smart Mirror for Stuttering Therapy

It uses computer vision + speech recognition to detect in real-time:

→ Blocks (silent struggle with open mouth or pressed lips)
→ Repetitions (sound/word stuttering patterns) 
→ Secondary behaviors (rapid blinking, facial tension)

The moment it detects you're struggling, it provides:
✓ Real-time visual feedback
✓ Breathing guidance
✓ Gentle reminders to ease through the moment


Why I built this:

Every day, millions of us avoid phone calls, presentations, or even ordering coffee because of how we speak.

This isn't just about fluency. It's about confidence.

⚠️ Note: This is a working prototype. It has false positives. It has rough edges. It's not perfect.

But I built it to solve a real problem I face daily—and if it helps even one other person, it's worth it. I’ll be working on improving this continuously and convert it to a fully fledged product and I'd love your feedback to make it better!
